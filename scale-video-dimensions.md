To calculate the new video width by changing its height, you can use the following formula:

**Width = Height * Aspect Ratio**

If you want to maintain the original aspect ratio of the video, you can use the following values:

* For 16:9 (Widescreen): 16/9
* For 4:3 (Fullscreen): 4/3
* For 21:9 (Ultra Widescreen): 21/9

For example, if you want to change the height of a video to 1080 pixels and maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio, you can calculate the new width as follows:

**Width = 1080 * (16/9) = 1920**

If you want to specify the new width, you can rearrange the formula to solve for the aspect ratio:

**Aspect Ratio = Width / Height**

You can then use this aspect ratio to maintain the original proportions when changing the height.
